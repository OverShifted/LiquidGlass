# Liquid glass
A shader inspired by Apple's [Liquid Glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_Glass) design language. 

It renders a squircle with a shader that approximates a signed distance field to
emulate refraction. With some blur, noise and a bit of glow, it ends up looking
somewhat like glass.
